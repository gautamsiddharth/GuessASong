Using the file name passed on the command line, this program will read a file and place the information from the file into an
array of structures where you will dynamically allocate the memory to store the fileâ€™s information. You are then using that
information to play the game. If you play the game and win, the winning entry is removed from the file so if you play again,
you do not see the choice you already guessed.
